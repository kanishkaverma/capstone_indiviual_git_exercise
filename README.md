# Repo for CAPSTONE indiviual git exercise

### The repo involves implementing bubble sort and insertion sort in python and documenting the git process

#

==================================================================================

## Feature list

- Insertion sort

  I first created a branch from master for this feature. Then I implemented this feature in its own file called insertion_sort.py. Furthermore, I wrote tests for it in tests.py using unittest module in python. I then made a Pull Request for the feature and merged to main.

- Bubble sort

  As I had created the branch of this feature before I merged the pull request, I had to rebase off of main after merging my insertion_sort pull request.
  After rebasing I added bubble_sort.py and added more tests to tests.py. I then made a PR to merge this into main as well and merged it.

- README

  After finishing both features, I branched off of main to update the README and then merged that branch into main as well.

==================================================================================

## How to run

- main.py

  main.py contains code to show how to use insertion_sort and bubble_sort. you can just simply import the methods from their respective files and then call the methods on lists of Integers. There is no error checking done as to what type of list is being passed. So, be careful. To run the tests, simply run tests.py

Thank you so much.\
